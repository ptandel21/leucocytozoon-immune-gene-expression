# Barn Owl Immune Gene Expression in Leucocytozoon Infection – BIOL 710 GitHub Assignment

This repository contains RNA-seq data and analysis scripts from a gene expression study of wild barn owls (*Tyto alba*) infected with the avian blood parasite *Leucocytozoon*. This project builds on a previously published RNA-seq dataset analyzing immune responses in *Tyto alba* infected with the blood parasite *Leucocytozoon*. The original study (by Caroline Faircloth) identified differentially expressed genes in owls co-infected with *Leucocytozoon* and Matryoshka RNA virus. This project expands her dataset by increasing replicates, focusing on gene expression patterns in owls infected with *Leucocytozoon* and MaRNAV. The goal is to expand upon a prior dataset by adding additional replicates and validating key immune-related genes (e.g., MAP4K4, HEBP1). This will support downstream ddPCR analysis and contribute to a publishable study.

## Project Objectives

- Load and inspect RNA-seq read count data from `.ReadsPerGene.out.tab` STAR output
- Prepare dataset for downstream immune gene analysis and ddPCR primer design
- Validate RNA-seq expression patterns for genes like **HEBP1**, **MAP4K4**, and others
- Build a clean GitHub repository with well-documented dataset and metadata
  
##  Repository Contents

- `data`: Folder containing merged gene expression `.csv` and `DatasetCard.md`
- `owl_gene_analysis.Rmd`: Project R Markdown file with code, figures, and interpretation
- `README.md`: Project summary and repo structure
